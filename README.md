# Task2

Hello Everyone. It is my 2nd task of Lets Upgrade Web Development Internship.

The task is "
  1. Create a User card grid layout having a navbar showing any brand name 

  2. Add a button in the navbar saying 'Get Users', which makes an API call to get the user data

  3. Use https://reqres.in/api/users?page=1 to get the data 

  4. Show a loader while the API fetches the data. 

  5. Use custom CSS/SASS/styled-components. 
".

I have created this site in React JS.

It contains two branches. One is main which contains code in react and second contains production code.
