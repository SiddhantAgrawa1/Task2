#Task2

Hello Everyone. It is my 2nd task of LetsGrowMore Web Development Internship.

The task is "

Create a User card grid layout having a navbar showing any brand name

Add a button in the navbar saying 'Get Users', which makes an API call to get the user data

Use https://reqres.in/api/users?page=1 to get the data

Show a loader while the API fetches the data.

Use custom CSS/SASS/styled-components. ".

I have created this site in React JS.

It contains two branches. One is main which contains code in react and second contains production code.

You can also check the live working of this site on following link
